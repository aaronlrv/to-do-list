# To-Do-List

This project is a To-Do-List application where users can Save, Add and Remove To-Do's

## My personal Takeways
This project was a immense challenge to construct due to all the features and being unable to think throughout the approach, Which greatly improved my problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Utilizing OOP (Object Oriented Programming) to this level was immensely challenging, I was also unfamiliar with classes at the time and had to get used to using them. 

## How to Use

Use the Github pages environment and view the latest deployment of the project (Note: If it gets stuck on computer turn feel free to refresh the page!)
